 <h2>The Top five Slice of Life Anime</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>1. Violet Evergarden</h3>
 <p>This anime has some of the most beautiful visuals and music score, any one will fall in love with this piece of art, also watching the main protagonist growth from not undrstanding the basic emotions like - "I love you" and trying to find its meaning through writing letters as a auto memomry doll in the company, It's very great 5/5 I recommend everyone to watch and eye opener.  </p>

 <h3>2.Clannad After-story</h3>
 <p> This is one the most emotional animes I have seen, The story revolves around the highschool girl nagisa who is sick most of the time and had also dropped a year in school, afterschool is the continuation of the clannad, here it shows more about the society and grown up adult life. Its also solid 5/5, highly recommeded</p>

 <h3>3.Angel Beats</h3>
 <p>Like clannad this also have some dramatic momemts, orinally the starting few episode were very comedic and later it goes into emotional where we discover protagonist background. It's very and also heartlifting at the same time.</p>

 <h3>4.Mushishi</h3>
 <p>This one is little different from the usual slice of life and it focuses on the adventure of the traveller Gingko, who goes from place to place to get help people suffering form disease cause by mushi- an entity which cannot be seen naturally by human beings though they live with humans since the creation of world and those who witness it , their life changes in some ways whether good or bad. It's solid watch</p>

 <h3>5.Fruit Basket</h3>
 <p>This one is very special to me, It has helped many times in my down time, whenever I am depressed, the story revolve around the girl tohru honda, who help soma family in healing their emotional trauamas. So it's very good and you also get to learn many great life lesson.</p>
